# DSXSkyrim-NG using CommonLibSSE

Here is the source code for my project.  It is not pretty and i basically had to learn c++.
Some issues i had was that the data structures did not allow mixed types(compared to C#) and 
there probably is some cleaner way to do this.  Also my headers are all messed up so it barely compiles as of now.

I have left this as an example for other hobbyists to mod other games that require C++ (if you using a games mod library like f4se). Otherwise, C# would be 100x easier to implement.


If you run the debug plugin dll that is generated, it expects a debugger to be attached.  You can attach to the process in visual studio and it will resume running as expected.  Note, remove the steam drm with steamless from the skyrim.exe
